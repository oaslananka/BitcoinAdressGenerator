# Bitcoin Address Generator

This Python script generates various types of Bitcoin addresses, including non-compressed, compressed, SegWit, and non-compressed SegWit addresses. It demonstrates the use of cryptographic techniques in Bitcoin address generation using the elliptic curve cryptography library.

## Features

- Generates non-compressed and compressed Bitcoin addresses.
- Supports SegWit and non-compressed SegWit address formats.
- Uses random private keys for each generation cycle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `base58` Python library
- `ellipticcurve` Python library

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oaslananka/BitcoinAdressGenerator.git
cd BitcoinAdressGenerator
pip install base58 ellipticcurve
```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python BitcoinAdressGenerator.py
```

The output will display the generated Bitcoin addresses and the private key used.
